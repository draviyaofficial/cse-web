    question: "How do creators earn money on Draviya?",
    answer:
      "Creators raise upfront capital by launching royalty-backed blockchain tokens through a structured Initial Royalty Offering (IRO). A portion of the proceeds is released to the creator, while the rest initializes on-chain liquidity. Over time, creators may also benefit from continued participation tied to activity around their token — all without ads, sponsorship dependence, or giving up ownership.",
  },
  {
    id: "02",
    question: "Do I need financial or crypto knowledge to participate?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. Draviya abstracts away most of the complexity. Pricing and liquidity are handled automatically by smart contracts, so you don’t need to understand trading mechanics or market math. You simply choose creators you believe in and interact through a simple, guided interface.",
  },
  {
    id: "03",
    question: "How do buying and selling work?",
    answer:
      "During the early phase, tokens use an automated bonding curve that provides on-chain liquidity, meaning interactions happen instantly without waiting for a counterparty. Once a token reaches predefined maturity thresholds, it transitions to an orderbook-based market where prices are discovered through open participation.",
  },
  {
    id: "04",
    question: "What happens as a creator grows in popularity?",
    answer:
      "As a creator’s ecosystem grows, demand for their token may increase. During the bonding-curve phase, this demand is reflected algorithmically in pricing. After the transition to an orderbook market, price discovery is driven by open participation. This allows the system to reflect creator momentum in a transparent, market-based way.",
  },
  {
    id: "05",
    question: "How safe and transparent is the platform?",
    answer:
      "All issuance, pricing logic, and token flows are handled by audited smart contracts. Funds are held on-chain, and key actions are verifiable in real time. The system is designed to minimize manual intervention and provide clear, rule-based behavior for both creators and participants.",
  },
  {
    id: "06",
    question: "Can any creator launch a token?",
    answer:
      "Creators go through a verification and eligibility process before launching. This helps maintain quality, reduce misuse, and ensure that only active, credible creators can issue royalty-backed tokens. Once approved, creators can launch through a structured and standardized process.",
  },
